The webapp will be called "Spectral Seedlings Inventory", as it's intended to be a base for a larger project I'd like to do for a friend.

The HTML will consist of a title header, a set of lists of products arranged by category, and an editing section for adding and removing categories and products.
The JS will add functionality to show products when their category is selected, as well as adding the functionality to add and remove categories and products.
A DB hosted through heroku will hold the categories and products in tables that reference each other.
The CSS styling should evoke "spooky bag."
